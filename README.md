This project is a poor implementation of a Roman-Decimal numbers converter.

The given tests should be enough for you to understand how roman numbers work.
You can find more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#%22Standard%22_forms). The form used is the Standard one with `substractive` notation.

You can rewrite/rework this using any language, but if you want to use Javascript here are some commands for you:
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the tests
yarn test

# Start the tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# You can get the coverage with both commands using --coverage
```
